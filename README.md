# Functional priors via NumPyro
An attempt at taking the core concept of functional priors from the paper *"All You Need is a Good Functional Prior for Bayesian Deep Learning"* and forked implementation, and implementing it with existing tools in NumPyro.

This attempts to align the concept with the PPL framework and samplers. Likely I have made some poor judgement calls on substituting methodology, but it appears it has potential to significantly improve the performance of BNNs built with NumPyro. Work in progress.

# All You Need is a Good Functional Prior for Bayesian Deep Learning

Code for the paper *"All You Need is a Good Functional Prior for Bayesian Deep Learning"*.

The code is under refactoring, feel free to contact me via email ([ba-hien.tran@eurecom.fr](ba-hien.tran@eurecom.fr)) if you have any issues or questions.

## Setup
We assume `python3.6` or `python3.7` since the package was developed with those versions. To install the package with `pip3` please clone this repository and then run the following
```
pip3 install .
```

## Example Usage

The subfolder `notebooks` contains jupyter notebooks to run experiments with regression and classification tasks. They also show how to use this package. Here, we included some demos as follows

- `1D_regression_Gaussian_prior.ipynb`: Comparison between `FG` and `GPiG` priors on a 1D regression data.
- `1D_regression_hierarchical_prior.ipynb`: Comparison between `FH` and `GPiH` priors on a 1D regression data set.
- `1D_regression_norm_flow_prior.ipynb`: Comparison between `Fixed NF` and `GPiNF` priors on 1D regression data.
- `2D_classification.ipynb`: The effect of using different configurations of the target GP prior to the predictive posterior on a 2D classification task.
- `2D_classification_hierarchical_gp_prior.ipynb`: The effect of using a target hierarchical-GP prior to the predictive posterior on a 2D classification task.
- `uci_regression.ipynb`: Comparison between `FG` and `GPiG` priors on a UCI data set.
